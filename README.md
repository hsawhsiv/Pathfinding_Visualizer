# Pathfinding_Visualizer
An interactive User interface to visualize Dijkstra's and A-Star algorithms on the web browser.

How to run the web app?
1) Install VS Studio in your system.
2) Make a separate New Folder in your system and download the six files in this Pathfinding_Visualizer folder into that New Folder.
3) Run all six files using VS Code. (You can right-click inside the folder and choose Open with Code option)
4) Open the .html extension file (dijkstra_astar.html) inside VS Code.
5) Right-click inside the open file and select Open with Live Server.

How to use this app?
1) Upon running dijkstra_astar.html with Live Server, you will see a 20 by 30 grid on your web browser.
2) Click on the white cells to choose your starting destination and again click on another cell to choose your final destination. The two chosen cells turn yellow.

3) Now choose the blockades by again clicking on the cells, any number of cells you choose after choosing the initial and final destination will be blocked and will turn grey.

4) Click on one of the buttons Shortest path using Dijkstra or Shortest path using A-Star to run the respective algorithms on the grid. Here is a demo run of Dijkstra.

5) Demo run on the same input for A-Star (without allowing Diagonal movements)

6) You can also run the A-Star Diagonal version in the same way by opening the .html extension file (astardiag.html) inside VS Code. Then Right-click inside the open file and select Open with Live Server option.
7) A new browser window will open on a different port.
8) Input the starting and final destinations and blocked cells in a similar fashion and then click on the find shortest path button.
9) Here is a demo run on the above input.
